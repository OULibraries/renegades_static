Sorey_Union_Drawing,https://www.dropbox.com/s/k93upxokwd8pih1/Sorey%20Union%20Drawing.png?dl=0,Oklahoma Memorial Union Perspective,"Facilities Management, University of Oklahoma","Tom Sorey and Walter Vahlberg were two designers based in Oklahoma City and educated in the Beaux Art system, the most important pedagogical approach in the US during the 1920s. Their project for the Oklahoma Memorial Union Building (1928-29) reflected the theories of American collegiate architecture, inspired by a historicist vision. The design was opposed to contemporary modern trends in architecture. The drawings show a traditional understanding of design problems and represent an important commentary on architecture in Oklahoma at the beginning of the last century. In 1920 Tom Sorey was in charge of the drawing department at the College of Engineering at OU. In the academic year 1924-25 Sorey had responsibility for teaching the courses in the first curriculum in architectural engineering. The North wing of the building was completed with alterations under the supervision of Joe Edgar Smay who was the first Director of the School of Architectural Engineering and set the first curriculum for architecture in 1929-30. In 1949 new additions by Sorey, Hill and Sorey Architects modified the Student Union as it was designed in 1927.

Professors assigned themes approved/proposed by the Beaux-Arts Institute and students participated in its competitions. In 1939 Nat Baker, Joe Boaz and Paul Jeffries, three students of architecture, won the preliminary stage of the prestigious Paris Prize. Jeffries, the only participant from a state west of the Mississippi during the final stage, was awarded seventh place for the Costumes and Ballroom for a Beaux Arts Ball inspired by Inca motifs. The study of the past was still considered important at the end of the 1930s but the project by Jeffries declares the new desire of modern architectural solutions, avoiding classical sources and an excessive use of decoration.

Thanks to Goff the ancient precedents and study of classical ornament were no longer considered the focus of the school. On the contrary Goff envisioned a new pedagogical approach and encouraged unusual and modern designs. Often inspired by keywords, music, and poems, Goff’s students designed architectural concepts reflecting their own creativity. This set of drawings, prepared by Donald K. Olsen for the 4thyear design studio course taught by Goff, is an example of the new pedagogy established by Goff at OU.",,,Donald Olsen,,,American School in Practice,The Goff Influence,Watercolor,Class Project,

Bruce Goff and his students wanted to explore new themes and motifs. Flying saucers, oneiric shapes, natural forms, vernacular buildings, and non-western architecture became sources of inspiration at the OU School of Architecture. As Goff declared: “We have need for accomplishment…We draw our own problems […] our aim is to develop architecture in this University for this part of the country. The copiers -the eclectics- learn how the Parthenon was built and follow its pattern…but they say, ‘you poor fools, you haven’t a chance.’ They expect to stand still.

Fascinated by the atomic era, Casper developed a proposal probably intended for the Arch 273 course. The design highlighted the contrast between spherical architectural elements and rectilinear volumes assembled together. Moreover, the proposal shows the contrast between the building and site: the project looks like an imaginary animal lost in an inhospitable desert.",,,Casper,,1960,American School in Practice,The Goff Influence,Drawing,Class Project,

This project by Loftis is a clear homage to Wright’s principles and design motifs. The close relationship between building and nature, horizontal architectural elements, ornament integrated into the structure, the use of new and natural materials are all features of his “organic” approach. In this project the student proposed a wooden awning and a reinforced concrete building dealing with water and elevated flower beds used as architectural volumes.

The assignment challenged students to “design an air terminal for Oklahoma City which would be adequate to serve present requirements, and which would be flexible enough to permit an independent expansion of all functions of the air terminal.” Everything in this design proposal recalls the movement and the circles drawn by airplane propellers. The functional requirements are organized into a three-level system of operation represented in the three plans selected for the exhibition. The main floor level is the ticket and check-in area where the passengers move to and from airplanes at a level just above ground level.  Four oval lounges characterize this level. 
The airplanes operate at ground level where the passengers and visitors can access the building using elevators. The ground level provides an area for trucks to service the air terminal without encountering passenger vehicles. All automobiles enter and leave the terminal at an underground level that is the lowest level and parking lot.

OU student Ebun Faturoti, who became a famous architect in Nigeria, designed a proposed house for the New President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, established a few years before. The project is a well-balanced composition of volumes inspired by International Style motifs rather than organic architecture principles. The design solution consists of a series of structures and buildings.

The organization’s mission is to promote the creative legacy of Bruce Goff, advance the tenets of Organic Architecture, and to bring attention to the works of original artists of meaning, integrity, and respect for the natural environment. The primary means of achieving these goals is through the publication of the Friends of Kebyar Journal and the establishment of a network of practitioners who embody Kebyar's mission. ""Kebyar"" is a Balinese word literally meaning ""the process of flowering."" It also designates a style in Balinese music and art connoting strength and vigor.

They offereed a way to share visual information to a group of people by projecting it on a screen. Even ""renegades"" are part of a cumulative cultural environment based on access to a past to resist or reject. The  “renegade” work of American School architects and their students did not exist in a vacuum but was informed by a range of design references recorded in these slides. Students were encouraged to experiment and innovate, while developing a design vocabulary that drew on global, vernacular examples. The American School pioneered active learning environments that valued individual creativity and expression above rote learning and mimicry. Even so, students in the OU architecture program in the 1940s and 1950s were exposed to a world of design elements – a Windsor chair, a Mesoamerican vessel, a Gothic façade, much has they had before Goff’s arrival.",,,,,1935,Archives,American School Curriculum,Lantern slide,Teaching tool ,

Vernacular architecture uses local materials, landscapes, tools and climate awareness to meet the material and social functions of shelter. Vernacular architecture is not without intent or design, and it may result in highly functional responses to the human need for shelter within specific topographies, environments, and cultures. A settler soddie or log cabin, a boom town canvas tent, a grass house, a hide and pole tipi, a bark lodge are all forms of vernacular architecture: organic and place-based, socially built, suitable and sustainable within the landscape of Oklahoma and the West. College of Architecture Professor Emeritus Charles Robert Goins studied in the OU architecture program, receiving his BA in 1955 and his MA in 1960. In 1980 the University of Oklahoma press published Oklahoma Homes Past and Present by Goins and John. W Morris. The book drew on the Libraries’ Western History Collections for images by early Oklahoma photographers Annett Ross Hume and Andrew Forbes. The book begins the story of Oklahoma shelter with the vernacular structures of Native peoples and early settlers.",,,,,,Archives,Vernacular Architecture in the West,Photograph,Vernacular Architecture,
