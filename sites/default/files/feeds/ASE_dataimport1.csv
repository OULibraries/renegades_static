Oklahoma Memorial Union Perspective,"Facilities Management, University of Oklahoma","Tom Sorey and Walter Vahlberg were two designers based in Oklahoma City and educated in the Beaux Art system, the most important pedagogical approach in the US during the 1920s. Their project for the Oklahoma Memorial Union Building (1928-29) reflected the theories of American collegiate architecture, inspired by a historicist vision. The design was opposed to contemporary modern trends in architecture. The drawings show a traditional understanding of design problems and represent an important commentary on architecture in Oklahoma at the beginning of the last century. In 1920 Tom Sorey was in charge of the drawing department at the College of Engineering at OU. In the academic year 1924-25 Sorey had responsibility for teaching the courses in the first curriculum in architectural engineering. The North wing of the building was completed with alterations under the supervision of Joe Edgar Smay who was the first Director of the School of Architectural Engineering and set the first curriculum for architecture in 1929-30. In 1949 new additions by Sorey, Hill and Sorey Architects modified the Student Union as it was designed in 1927.

Costumes and Ballroom for a Beaux-Arts Ball,"College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma","During the early years under Joe Smay’s direction, the School of Architecture cooperated with the New York Beaux-Arts Institute of Design. Professors assigned themes approved/proposed by the Beaux-Arts Institute and students participated in its competitions. In 1939 Nat Baker, Joe Boaz and Paul Jeffries, three students of architecture, won the preliminary stage of the prestigious Paris Prize. Jeffries, the only participant from a state west of the Mississippi during the final stage, was awarded seventh place for the Costumes and Ballroom for a Beaux Arts Ball inspired by Inca motifs. The study of the past was still considered important at the end of the 1930s but the project by Jeffries declares the new desire of modern architectural solutions, avoiding classical sources and an excessive use of decoration.

Greek Ionic Column,"Sketch of Greek Ionic column. Exercise for Arch 62 course “Shades, Shadow and perspective.” Report Compiled for the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, 1931.","In 1930, Frank C. Morris, a graduate student, taught the Arch 61 and Arch 62 courses which focused on representation problems, perspective and theory of light. In the Beaux-Arts spirit, the older students were involved in teaching and helped freshmen and sophomore in their assignments. The drawings represented classical orders and ornament, based on the technique of copying and on the assignments published by the Beaux Arts Institute of Design.",,,J.M. Bell,,1930,American School in Practice,Pre-American School Architecture,Watercolor,Class Project
Farmers Trust Company ,"Front elevation and details for a Farmers Trust Company building, Exercise for Arch 61 course “Shades, Shadow and perspective.""",The first work in the course consisted of determining the shades and shadows on and cast by various shaped figures. The plate here reproduced should be considered a preliminary study of the so called “Analytique” to which about five weeks was allowed at the end of the course. The “Analytique” or order problem was a design problem in proportion and in the elements of architecture and their relationship with the whole design.,,,,,1930,American School in Practice,Pre-American School Architecture,Watercolor,Class Project
Jupiter Temple,"Temple de Jupiter Stator a Rome, Exercise for Arch 62 course “Shades, Shadow and perspective”. A Report Compiled for the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, 1931.",After several weeks of descriptive geometry exercises the students were required to apply their knowledge to architectural elements. In this drawing the student designed hypothetical ornament details of the Temple of Jupiter Stator in Rome. The floral element shadows are cast accurately in India ink washes.,,,Al M.

Doorway to an Architect's Building,"Doorway to an Architects Building, Exercise for Arch 62 course “Shades, Shadow and perspective”. Report Compiled for the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, 1931.","This plate was prepared as a 2nd year design problem. As described in the label for “Front elevation and details for a Farmers Trust Company building” this is a typical example of a preliminary “Analytique”. The student was required to work on design solutions for the façade, ornament details, columns and their capitals. ",,,Al M. Kendall,,1930,American School in Practice,Pre-American School Architecture,Watercolor,Class Project
Study: Opacity,"College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma","The arrival of Bruce Goff constituted a turning point in the architectural education at OU. Thanks to Goff the ancient precedents and study of classical ornament were no longer considered the focus of the school. On the contrary Goff envisioned a new pedagogical approach and encouraged unusual and modern designs. Often inspired by keywords, music, and poems, Goff’s students designed architectural concepts reflecting their own creativity. This set of drawings, prepared by Donald K. Olsen for the 4thyear design studio course taught by Goff, is an example of the new pedagogy established by Goff at OU.",,,Donald Olsen,,,American School in Practice,The Goff Influence,Watercolor,Class Project
Study: Depth ,"College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma",If we compare these quick sketches by Donald K. Olsen to the drawings developed during the 1930s at OU we can see the difference between Goff’s ideals and the traditional approach to architecture. We should understand these drawings as a declaration of independence from the classical design problems and assignments prepared by the Beaux-Arts Institute in New York.,,,Donald Olsen,,,American School in Practice,The Goff Influence,Watercolor,Class Project
Study: Counterpoint ,"College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma","A new aesthetic emerged in the ‘50s. Bruce Goff and his students wanted to explore new themes and motifs. Flying saucers, oneiric shapes, natural forms, vernacular buildings, and non-western architecture became sources of inspiration at the OU School of Architecture. As Goff declared: “We have need for accomplishment…We draw our own problems […] our aim is to develop architecture in this University for this part of the country. The copiers -the eclectics- learn how the Parthenon was built and follow its pattern…but they say, ‘you poor fools, you haven’t a chance.’ They expect to stand still. We expect to go forward.”",,,Donald Olsen,,,American School in Practice,The Goff Influence,Watercolor,Class Project
"Flower Shop in Norman, Elevation","College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma","This project proposal designed by Ernest Burden is a 2ndyear design problem for Arch 61, an intermediate design studio class taught during the second semester by William S. Burgett, who also taught history of architecture.  As described in the College Bulletin of 1954 in Arch 61 course the students dealt with problems of medium complexity, emphasizing closer coordination of design, structure and other elements. ",,,Ernest Burden,,1954,American School in Practice,The Goff Influence,Drawing,Class Project
"Flower Shop in Norman, Plans and Sections","College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma", The Flower Shop is surrounded by nature but includes plants and flowers in the interior spaces as the section clearly shows. Looking at the plan the design is characterized by circular shapes. The domed volumes are something in between circus tents and futuristic vehicles immersed in a fantastic atmosphere.,,,Ernest Burden,,1954,American School in Practice,The Goff Influence,Drawing,Class Project
An Atomic Power Station,"College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma","The Atomic Power Station designed by John Casper was not a building based on specific and real program. Fascinated by the atomic era, Casper developed a proposal probably intended for the Arch 273 course. The design highlighted the contrast between spherical architectural elements and rectilinear volumes assembled together. Moreover, the proposal shows the contrast between the building and site: the project looks like an imaginary animal lost in an inhospitable desert.",,,Casper,,1960,American School in Practice,The Goff Influence,Drawing,Class Project
"Depth, Reflection, and Transparency","College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma","The school of architecture at OU promoted Frank Lloyd Wright’s work and his organic architectural philosophy. This project by Loftis is a clear homage to Wright’s principles and design motifs. The close relationship between building and nature, horizontal architectural elements, ornament integrated into the structure, the use of new and natural materials are all features of his “organic” approach. In this project the student proposed a wooden awning and a reinforced concrete building dealing with water and elevated flower beds used as architectural volumes. A series of windows makes the building permeable to sunlight.",,,Jim Loftis,,1963,American School in Practice,The Goff Influence,Drawing,Class Project
"Oklahoma City Air Terminal, Main Floor Level ","College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma","These three drawings by Gene Williams are taken from a set of 7 sheets on tracing paper. The assignment challenged students to “design an air terminal for Oklahoma City which would be adequate to serve present requirements, and which would be flexible enough to permit an independent expansion of all functions of the air terminal.” Everything in this design proposal recalls the movement and the circles drawn by airplane propellers. The functional requirements are organized into a three-level system of operation represented in the three plans selected for the exhibition. The main floor level is the ticket and check-in area where the passengers move to and from airplanes at a level just above ground level.  Four oval lounges characterize this level. 
The airplanes operate at ground level where the passengers and visitors can access the building using elevators. The ground level provides an area for trucks to service the air terminal without encountering passenger vehicles. All automobiles enter and leave the terminal at an underground level that is the lowest level and parking lot.

"Residence, Nigerian President, Ibadan","College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma","Although Frank Lloyd Wright’s theories on organic architecture were promoted at OU, the students were free to explore other architectural approaches. OU student Ebun Faturoti, who became a famous architect in Nigeria, designed a proposed house for the New President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, established a few years before. The project is a well-balanced composition of volumes inspired by International Style motifs rather than organic architecture principles. The design solution consists of a series of structures and buildings. A ceremonial hall, that is the main building of the complex, is arranged between two courts in the middle of the composition.",,,Ebun Faturoti,,1966,American School in Practice,The Goff Influence,Mixed Media,Class Project
A Crystal Palace ,"College of Architecture, University of Oklahoma","After Goff’s departure the school maintained its efforts to promote individual creativity.  
This drawing by Henderson represents an oneiric building proposal that explores in depth the concept of transparency through the use of colors. Henderson became an instructor at OU and is now a Professor Emeritus of Architecture. He is the author of Bruce Goff: Architecture of Discipline in Freedom, a book published by University of Oklahoma Press.

Inventory of the Library of Bruce Goff,"Bruce Goff Archive, Art Institute of Chicago","Bruce Goff’s work as an architect was informed by many disciplines and creative practices. Goff’s personal library contained nearly 700 books on architecture – and over 2,700 books on art, music, literature, and other topics. Many are in languages other than English (the page on view includes materials in Dutch, German, and Turkish, and a separate portion of the library inventory is devoted to books in Asian Languages). Goff’s influences and interests were global and eclectic.

"Lantern slide, Tecton-Lubtkin House","Lantern slide collection, College of Architecture","Glass lantern slides date from the 19th century, and persisted in classrooms in the College of Architecture into the mid-20th century. They offereed a way to share visual information to a group of people by projecting it on a screen. Even ""renegades"" are part of a cumulative cultural environment based on access to a past to resist or reject. The  “renegade” work of American School architects and their students did not exist in a vacuum but was informed by a range of design references recorded in these slides. Students were encouraged to experiment and innovate, while developing a design vocabulary that drew on global, vernacular examples. The American School pioneered active learning environments that valued individual creativity and expression above rote learning and mimicry. Even so, students in the OU architecture program in the 1940s and 1950s were exposed to a world of design elements – a Windsor chair, a Mesoamerican vessel, a Gothic façade, much has they had before Goff’s arrival.",,,,,1935,Archives,American School Curriculum,Lantern slide,Teaching tool

This Leroy lettering set is a pantograph, used to create standardized lettering on hand-drawn plans and elevations.

Wichita grass house in Anadarko,"Annette Ross Hume Collection, Western History Collections","Vernacular or “indigenous” architecture describes a built environment that is not designed by architects but by inhabitants. Vernacular architecture uses local materials, landscapes, tools and climate awareness to meet the material and social functions of shelter. Vernacular architecture is not without intent or design, and it may result in highly functional responses to the human need for shelter within specific topographies, environments, and cultures. A settler soddie or log cabin, a boom town canvas tent, a grass house, a hide and pole tipi, a bark lodge are all forms of vernacular architecture: organic and place-based, socially built, suitable and sustainable within the landscape of Oklahoma and the West. College of Architecture Professor Emeritus Charles Robert Goins studied in the OU architecture program, receiving his BA in 1955 and his MA in 1960. In 1980 the University of Oklahoma press published Oklahoma Homes Past and Present by Goins and John. W Morris. The book drew on the Libraries’ Western History Collections for images by early Oklahoma photographers Annett Ross Hume and Andrew Forbes. The book begins the story of Oklahoma shelter with the vernacular structures of Native peoples and early settlers.",,,,,,Archives,Vernacular Architecture in the West,Photograph,Vernacular Architecture
