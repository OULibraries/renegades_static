Professors assigned themes approved/proposed by the Beaux-Arts Institute and students participated in its competitions. In 1939Nat Baker, Joe Boaz and Paul Jeffries, three students of architecture, won the preliminary stage of the prestigious Paris Prize. Jeffries, the only participant from a state west of the Mississippi during the final stage, was awarded seventh place for the Costumes and Ballroom for a Beaux Arts Ball inspired by Inca’s motifs. The study of the past was still considered important at the end of the 1930s but the project by Jeffries declares the new desire of modern architectural solutions, avoiding classical sources and an excessive use of decoration.",P.F.

Picture taken from Report Compiled for the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture","Their project for the Oklahoma Memorial Union Building (1928-29) reflected the theories of American collegiate architecture, inspired by a historicist vision. The design was opposed to contemporary modern trends in architecture. The drawings show a traditional understanding of design problems and represent an important commentary on architecture in Oklahoma at the beginning of the last century. In 1920 Tom Sorey was in charge of the drawing department at the College of Engineering at OU. In the academic year 1924-25 Sorey had responsibility for teaching the courses in the first curriculum in architectural engineering.",J.M. Bell,1930,Class Project-Watercolor

The plate here reproduced should be considered a preliminary study of the so called “Analytique” to which about five weeks was allowed at the end of the course. The “Analytique” or order problem was a design problem in proportion and in the elements of architecture and their relationship with the whole design.,,1930,Class Project-Watercolor

Opacity_001,https://www.dropbox.com/s/4s6to2jfr5nqyhk/Opacity_001.jpg?dl=0,Opacity,"The arrival of Bruce Goff constituted a turning point in the architectural education at OU. Thanks to Goff the ancient precedents and study of classical ornament were no longer considered the focus of the school. On the contrary Goff envisioned a new pedagogical approach and encouraged unusual and modern designs. Often inspired by keywords, music, and poems, Goff’s students designed architectural concepts reflecting their own creativity. This set of drawings, prepared by Donald K. Olsen for the 4thyear design studio course taught by Goff, is an example of the new pedagogy established by Goff at OU.",Donald Olsen,,Class project-watercolor
Depth_001,https://www.dropbox.com/s/jurbpntig70y1dq/Depth_001.jpg?dl=0,Depth student assignment,If we compare these quick sketches by Donald K. Olsen to the drawings developed during the 1930s at OU we can see the difference between Goff’s ideals and the traditional approach to architecture. We should understand these drawings as a declaration of independence from the classical design problems and assignments prepared by the Beaux-Arts Institute in New York.,Donald Olsen,,Class project-watercolor
counterpoint balance,https://www.dropbox.com/s/e8kkbhu0nmg5dhs/counterpoint%20balance.jpg?dl=0,Counterpoint balance,"A new aesthetic emerged in the ‘50s. Bruce Goff and his students wanted to explore new themes and motifs. Flying saucers, oneiric shapes, natural forms, vernacular buildings, and non-western architecture became sources of inspiration at the OU School of Architecture. As Goff declared: “We have need for accomplishment…We draw our own problems […] our aim is to develop architecture in this University for this part of the country. The copiers -the eclectics- learn how the Parthenon was built and follow its pattern…but they say, ‘you poor fools, you haven’t a chance.’ They expect to stand still. We expect to go forward.”",Donald Olsen,,class project-watercolor

Burgett, who also taught history of architecture.  As described in the College Bulletin of 1954 in Arch 61 course the students dealt with problems of medium complexity, emphasizing closer coordination of design, structure and other elements. The Flower Shop is surrounded by nature but includes plants and flowers in the interior spaces as the section clearly shows. Looking at the plan the design is characterized by circular shapes.

Fascinated by the atomic era, Casper developed a proposal probably intended for the Arch 273 course. The design highlighted the contrast between spherical architectural elements and rectilinear volumes assembled together. Moreover, the proposal shows the contrast between the building and site: the project looks like an imaginary animal lost in an inhospitable desert.",Casper,1960,Class Project-Drawing

This project by Loftis is a clear homage to Wright’s principles and design motifs. The close relationship between building and nature, horizontal architectural elements, ornament integrated into the structure, the use of new and natural materials are all features of his “organic” approach. In this project the student proposed a wooden awning and a reinforced concrete building dealing with water and elevated flower beds used as architectural volumes. A series of windows makes the building permeable to sunlight.",Jim Loftis,1963,Class project-Drawing
Williams 19xx_001,https://www.dropbox.com/s/mgam35w2b7xq90h/Williams%2019xx_001.jpg?dl=0,Oklahoma City Air Terminal Main Floor Level ,"These three drawings by Gene Williams are taken from a set of 7 sheets on tracing paper. The assignment challenged students to “design an air terminal for Oklahoma City which would be adequate to serve present requirements, and which would be flexible enough to permit an independent expansion of all functions of the air terminal.” Everything in this design proposal recalls the movement and the circles drawn by airplane propellers. The functional requirements are organized into a three-level system of operation represented in the three plans selected for the exhibition. The main floor level is the ticket and check-in area where the passengers move to and from airplanes at a level just above ground level.  Four oval lounges characterize this level. 
The airplanes operate at ground level where the passengers and visitors can access the building using elevators. The ground level provides an area for trucks to service the air terminal without encountering passenger vehicles. All automobiles enter and leave the terminal at an underground level that is the lowest level and parking lot.

OU student Ebun Faturoti, who became a famous architect in Nigeria, designed a proposed house for the New President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, established a few years before. The project is a well-balanced composition of volumes inspired by International Style motifs rather than organic architecture principles. The design solution consists of a series of structures and buildings. A ceremonial hall, that is the main building of the complex, is arranged between two courts in the middle of the composition.",Ebun Faturoti,1966,Class project-Mixed Media
